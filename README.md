# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine the total fares from Janauary to April for each city type.
## Results
It is clear that the total fares for urban neighborhoods are much higher than both suburban and rural neighborhoods. This is due to the urban neighborhoods having many more drivers compared to the other neighborhoods. The average fare per rider is much higher in rural areas, but the average fare per driver is much higher. This is in comparison to urban areas where the average fare per rider is much lower but the average fare per driver is much lower as well. The suburban neighborhoods seem to have a healthy mix of total rides and drivers to balance out the average fare per ride and driver. 

## Summary
Based on the findings, one recommendation I would make would be to lower the cost of fares for riders in urban areas. This would help improve access to underserved neighborhoods. Another recommendation would be to get more drivers to rural neighborhoods to help improve access to drivers and lower costs. My third recommendation would be to add additional drivers to the suburban neighborhoods to help with supply/demand and lowering the costs.
